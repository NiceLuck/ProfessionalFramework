            <h1>The Data Protection Act 2018</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>What is the data protection act?</h2>
            <p>The data protection Act 2018 is UK legislation covering the use and processing of personal data. It’s used in tandem with General Data Protection Regulation and specifies how GDPR applies to the UK.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lawfulness, fairness and transparency</li>
                <li>Purpose limitation</li>
                <li>Data minimisation</li>
                <li>Accuracy</li>
                <li>Storage limitation</li>
                <li>Integrity and confidentiality</li>
                <li>Accountability</li>
              </ul>
              <hr>
              <!-- Lawfulness -->
            <h3>Lawfulness, fairness and transparency</h3>
            <p>Before personal data is collected & processed it must fall under one of the following six headings. Point one and two will be most relevant to our organisation. </p>  
            <h4>Lawful basis for processing</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Consent - From the individual.</li>
                <li>Contract - Personal Information is needed to fulfil a contract.</li>
                <li>Legal obligation - Collection & Processing is needed to comply with the law.</li>
                <li>Vital interests - To Save someones life</li>
                <li>Public task - Performing a task in the public interest</li>
                <li>Legitimate interests</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Fairness</h4>
            <p>Fairness referes to a persons right to have their data proccessed in a way that they would resonably expect. Data must not be proccessed in a way that negatively impacts an individual.</p>

            <h4>Transparency</h4>
                <p>Individuals have a right to know how their data is being processed. This must be available in an easy to understand manor. This can often be found under privacy information.</p>

            <!-- Purpose Limitation -->
            <h3>Purpose limitation</h3>
            <p>Purpose limitation dictates what data can be taken. Personal data must be collected with a documented specific purpose, this purpose must be available as privacy information for individuals. Personal data cannot be shared across departments unless it is for a purpose which is very similar to the original. Explicit consent from a person can be given to share their data.</p>
            <h4>What must you do?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Collect data for a specific purpose only.</li>
                <li>Document how the data will be used and make it available to users.</li>
                <li>Review current methods while keeping documentation relevant.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>What can't you do?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Share data across departments without specific reasons close to the original reason for the data.</li>
                <li>Record personal data  that is not relevant.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Workplace examples</h4>
            <p class = "quote">"Karen works in management. She is creating a form to collect contact information for AWS clients. One of the fields on the form is ‘Interests’ which she plans to share with marketing later." </p>
            <p>This is beyond the scope of her goal of collecting contact information Unless she gets explicit consent from the clients first.</p>

            </ul>
            <hr>
            <!-- Data Minimisation -->
            <h3>Data minimisation</h3>
            <p>The minimal amount of personal data needed to fulfil its purpose should be identified.  Periodical reviews should be carried out to ensure the personal data is still relevant.</p>
            <h4>Example 1</h4>
            <p class = "quote">
                The Software engineering team have created an app which tracks your location and gives directions for cyclists. It is allowed to track the users location while they are using the app. It is not allowed to continue to track them once they have closed the app. Collecting personal information such as visited places is not allowed without explicit consent.
            </p>
            <h4>Example 2</h4>
            <p class="quote">
                The network services department used to manage a client’s servers remotely using SSH. The client has stated they no longer require our services so the SSH keys should be deleted. 
            </p>

            <hr>
            <!-- Accuracy -->
            <h3>Accuracy</h3>
            <p>Reasonable steps should be taken to make sure personal data is accurate and up to date. Users have a right to rectification if personal data about them is inaccurate. </p>
            <h4>Example 1</h4>
            <p class = "quote">Marketing keeps contact details of previous customers for future marketing purposes. It does not have to use data-matching or tracing services to ensure records are up to date.</p>
            <h4>Example 2</h4>
            <p class = "quote"></p>
            <hr>
            <!-- Storage Limitation -->
            <h3>Storage Limitation</h3>
            <p>How long data is stored for should be clearly set out in a 'standard retention period' document. Audits should be in place to check what data is being stored and is it still relevant. Individuals have a right to their personal data being erased if it is no longer needed.</p>
            <h4>Example 1</h4>
            <p class = "quote">Janet has left management, personal information about Janet should be deleted that not longer has relevance, but data such as pension and payslips should be kept for a time.</p>
            <h4>Example 2</h4>
            <p class = "quote"></p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Security Principle</h3>
            <p>A Key principle of the UK data protection act is security, which outlines what considerations should be in place to protect personal data. Depending on the data, sufficient level of security needs to be put in place. Security is often multi-layered and there will be many levels of protection already implemented.</p>
            <h4>Tips for Users</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not plug any unknown usb's into devices - instead hand in to management.</li>
                <li>Do not click any links in emails without being 100% certain of the sender</li>
                <li>Do not take sensitive data home to use on your own device</li>
                <li>Do not leave your device unattended while signed in</li>
                <li>Use Multifactor Authentication where possible</li>
                <li>Use Strong Passwords</li>
                <li>Use Anyvirus proection & Firewall</li>
                <li>Use a secure VPN</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Example 1</h4>
            <p class="quote">Mike from marketing has just got an email from Google, it says his password has been compromised and he needs to sign in to change it immediately. Mike notices that the sender address does not look legitimate so he goes to his email provider manually to check whether everything is okay. Afterwards mike reports the email to his it manager.</p>
            <p>An excellent response to a phishing email.</p>
