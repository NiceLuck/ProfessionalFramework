            <!-- Paragraph One -->
            <h2>What is intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
                Intellectual Property (IP) is a blueprint which protects your work from being stolen or copied.<br>Here are a few examples.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Product name</li>
                <li>inventions</li>
                <li>Product design</li>
                <li>What your create, design or write</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <hr>


            <!-- Pharagraph Two -->
            <h3>Specification of Intellectual Property</h3>
            <p>
                An Intellectual protocol is where someone creates something with there own ideas or physical actions. From developing a
                new car to a scientific discovery. Where’s taking credit from someone else’s work is considered fraud. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <hr>


            <!-- Pharagraph Three -->
            <h3>Intellectual Property Ownership</h3>
            <p>You hold the rights as a intellectual property owner if you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed it yourself</li>
                <li>Transferred the rightful ownership</li>
                <li>Wellknown brand with trademarkes, such as Pepsi, or Kelloggs</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Intellectual property benefits</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Belonging to a specific person</li>
                <li>Have multiple owners</li>
                <li>Being sold or distributed</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <hr>

            <!-- Pharagraph Four -->
            <h3>Self-employed Intellectual Property Owners</h3>
            <p>
                Self-employed staff will most likely own the IP especially if its commissioned by a different owner – unless you handed
                your rights over to them.
            </p>
            <br>
            <hr>


            <!-- Pharagraph Five  -->
            <h3>Protect your Intellectual Property</h3>
            <p>
                Taking legal action is critical if you’ve developed either your own invention or developed a story. Doing so gives you
                protection from people trying to take credit, steel or duplicate it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <hr>


            <!-- Pharagraph Six  -->
            <h3>Types of Protection</h3>
            <p>
                It all depends on the circumstances. While some your intitled to automatically others you need to apply for.
            </p>

            <h6>Automatically protected</h6>
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    Copyright – Steeling someone’s work and using it as a form of your own. Such as copying work of google and pasting it into your assignment, also known as plagiarism or copyright.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Design right – Also known as a design you invented. Such as a house, car, website, or image. So if you steel someone’s design, your pretty much breaking the law
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Protection you must apply for</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Trademark - Such as names, logos, or insignia. (4 months flexibility to apply.)
                </li>

                <li>
                    Registered design – A products design, like boxing, shape, layout, colours, or declaration. (1-month flexibility to apply.)
                </li>

                <li>
                    Patents – Stops someone from taking, working on, using or selling an invention for a period of time (5 years flexibility to apply.)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Its recommended keeping these intellectual protocols silent until your work is registered. But discussing your ideas
                with someone is recommended using a non-disclosure agreement.
            </p>
            <br>

            <!-- Pharagraph Seven  -->
            <h3>Using multiple protection types</h3>
            <p>
                Must often multiple protection types are used for a singular project, Such as.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Registering a name or logo as a trademark.</li>
                <li>Protecting a brand’s unique infrastructure</li>
                <li>Patent a newly developed mechanical part.</li>
                <li>Using copyright to protect your music, design, or ideas from being used by others.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Defending your intellectual property</h3>
            <p>
                You must take responsibility in defending your intellectual property. From someone using or stealing your ideas, design
                or invention without permission, also known as “infringement”. It’s your duty in taking action if this accrues.
            </p>
            <u>Here are some examples.</u>
            <ul>
                <li>Someone using or selling your product as their own</li>
                <li>Requiring most or all of your products design and implementing it into their own, such as design, colouring, pattens, etc.</li>
                <li>A trademark similar to your registered version.</li>
            </ul>

            <u>Here are some examples.</u>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Either confront the offender to stop copying your IP or make an agreement. Such as licensing your IP
                </li>
                <li>Use a mediation or another source of dispute resolution.</li>
                <li>Take legal action if the manner isn’t resolved.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Implement a mediator</h3>
            <p>
                Mediators are used if two companies can’t complete an agreement between an Intellectual property dispute. Here are some
                examples where mediators are most often implemented within an organisation.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trademark - a company’s name, logo, shape, etc.</li>
                <li>Copyright - someone steeling your work and taking credit for it.</li>
                <li>Design – blueprints, shapes, colours, pattens, etc.</li>
                <li>Patent – A licence which temporarily excludes someone from either making, using, or selling a invention.</li>

            <h3>Trade secrets</h3>
            <p>
                Trade secrets are implemented by organisations to keep confidential data private. This is commonly implemented to stop
                other competitive companies from viewing their secrets. Without trade secrets everyone would know your companies deep
                and darkest secrets which would most definitely result in a huge if not permanent market loss.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                We worked as a team and encountered many problems whiles using GitHub. Some had more experience with this than others
                which is why we had regular meetings ensuring we all understand are individual tasks and how to operate GithHub.
                Developing an assignment as a group was pretty nerve racking at first as we’re counting on everyone to play their
                individual part. But overall we all had one goal, finish the assignment quick but with good quality.<br><br>
                
                At the start of the assignment we had a meeting on zoom and during that meeting Me, Luke and everyone else started
                planning their roles. Whiles I was planning intellectual protocols and viewing multiple websites to gather a clear idea
                and a deeper analysis as to how and why we have IP’s as a law, everyone else done the same but with their project. When
                the planning and tasks was complete, we uploaded are work onto GitHub which Dylan was currently hosting the website. As
                to then we implemented are code into HTML and uploaded a basic building block of are companies’<br><br>
                
                Using GitHub wasn’t are most humble website, as to then we found it pretty annoying using GitHub at first as we where
                keep on running into problems, but we worked and solved the problem together as a team. So, using GitHub wasn’t
                potentially are greatest option but we stuck with it and we pulled through it as a team and any errors we encountered we
                solved it as a team.<br><br>
                
                When we all completed are individual tasks there was one task left. We didn’t fight like pre-school kids as to who is
                going to complete it, we worked together and divided it up so everyone completed a small chunk of the last section.
