              The next level of this is serious harm including but not limited to loss of life or disruption on a major lever.
              Lastly it looks at giving someone an item with intent to see someone else commit act 3 or 3ZA.</p>

              Someone is caught assaulting another person with company hardware.
              Someone is preventing access to company systems that may be supplying nutrition or medical treatmant. This becomes a more seriours case.
              Someone violently assults someone causing illness or loss of life. This is another serious case.
              Anyone found breaking these laws can be liable for up to ten years and fine in section 3 or the more serious cases in 3ZA you could end up with a life sentence and hefty fine.
              If you catch anyone acting out in a voilent maner do not put yourself endanger but call security or inform someone to do so immediately.

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <br>
            <p>In short respect the companies and fellow employees data. The only information you should be accessing is your own or what you have been tasked with.
              getting someone else to do the dirty work for you or being commissioned by someone is illegal and you should report anyone acting suspicious to your manager.
              damage or corruption of files is sackable and criminal offence so pay at most respect to the equipment you are using. Violence against staff or anyone in the premises is not tolerated.
              If we all follow these rules with care then we can all share a happy and enjoyable work experience.
            </p>
